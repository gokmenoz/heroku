                Modeling Lending Club Loans
            </h1>

            <p><a href="https://www.lendingclub.com/">Lending Club</a>
            is a peer-to-peer lending site, where investors can browse and
            buy consumer loans. The interest rates on these loans may be as
            high as 25%, but such loans naturally carry a high risk of default.
            If we can build a system to predict which loans will default, we
            can dramatically improve our returns.  The source code (including the analysis) can be found <a href="https://github.com/tianhuil/isaac-thedataincubator-project">here</a>.</p>

            <p>This is <a href="https://github.com/carrutstick">Isaac Carruthers</a>'s project while a fellow at <a href="http://www.thedataincubator.com/">The Data Incubator</a>.  The Data Incubator is an intensive six-week fellowship that prepares the best scientists and engineers with advanced degrees to work as data scientists and quants. It identifies fellows who already have the 90% difficult-to-learn skills and equips them with the last 10%: the tools and technology stack that make them self-sufficient, productive contributors.</p>
